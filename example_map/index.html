<h1>Town Hall Project Map</h1>

<h3>About this Map</h3>
<p>This map is based on data from the Town Hall Project 2018.  I like working with maps and data, so I decided to
give visualizing this important dataset a shot. All credit for the data collected goes to the folks behind the Town Hall Project</p>
